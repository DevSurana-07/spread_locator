# 🛒 Transaction Behavior Analysis using Probability Distributions  

## 🎯 Objective  
Apply **probability distributions** and **spread analysis** on customer transaction data to derive insights into purchasing behavior.  

## 📊 Project Scenario  
As a data analyst for an **e-commerce platform**, the goal is to:  
- 🔍 Analyze **daily transaction amounts** of customers.  
- 📈 Test if data follows statistical distributions.  
- ⚖️ Handle skewed data using transformations.  
- 💡 Derive probability-based insights for decision-making.  

## 📂 Dataset Structure  
| 🏷️ Field Name       | 🔢 Type   | 📝 Description                              |
|----------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| 🆔 transaction_id    | UUID      | Unique identifier for each transaction      |
| 👤 customer_id       | UUID      | Unique identifier for each customer         |
| 💰 transaction_amount| Float     | Total transaction amount (₹)                |
| 📅 transaction_date  | Date      | Date of transaction                         |
| 🔢 transaction_count | Int       | No. of transactions by a customer/week      |
| 🌍 region            | String    | Customer region (North, South, East, West)  |
| ✅ transaction_status| String    | Transaction result (Success/Fail)           |

## ✅ Task Checklist  

### 📘 Part A – Theory  
- 📊 Explain statistical distributions, Q-Q plot, discrete vs continuous, Bernoulli, Binomial, Log-Normal, Power Law, Poisson, Box-Cox transform, Z-score, PDF & CDF.  

### 💻 Part B – Data Analysis (Python: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
1. 🎲 Fit data to Bernoulli & Binomial distributions.  
2. 🔔 Apply Poisson distribution (transactions/day).  
3. 📐 Model amounts using Log-Normal & Power Law.  
4. 📊 Generate & interpret Q-Q plots.  
5. 🔄 Apply Box-Cox transform for variance stabilization.  
6. 🧮 Compute Z-scores & probability of transactions > ₹5000.  
7. 📈 Plot & analyze PDF & CDF.  
8. 🏆 Conclude best-fit distribution & insights.  

## 🚀 Outcome  
- 🎯 Identify suitable statistical distributions for transaction behavior.  
- 💡 Provide actionable insights for e-commerce decision-making.
